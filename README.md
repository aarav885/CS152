Compiler Design Project


Academic Project: Designed a compiler for a mock language dubbed 'miniL.' Phase 1 of the project consisted of creating a lexical analyzer for a context free grammar. This was achieved using a tool called flex, that allows for the creation of tokens, of which are used as restricted words in the next phase. Phase 2 of the project consisted of designing a parser using the bison/yacc tools. These tools allow for the creation of a deterministic LR0 parser using LALR parsing tables. Phase 3 of the project consists of intermediate code generation using the MIL interpreter tools. The MIL interpreter allows for the creation of code using the parser created during the previous phase alongside a file that contains MIL source code.
