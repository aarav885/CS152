Compiler Design Project
Academic Project: Designed a complier capable of executing basic programs in a mock language called miniL. Designed a lexical analyzer, parser, and an intermediate code generator. The project was done using the flex tools for the lexical analyzer, bison/yacc for the parser, and the MIL interpreter tools for the intermediate code generation.
